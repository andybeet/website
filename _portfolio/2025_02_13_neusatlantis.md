Atlantis is a series of submodels (biological, geophysical, fishing, assessment, and management) and as a whole simulates a Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE) procedure which allows for qualitative comparisons of different management choices. Originally developed to answer questions focused on the biophysical world and fisheries it has grown to answer other question relating to contaminants and climate.

We have parameterized Atlantis for the Northeast United States Continental Shelf (NEUS), including the major functional groups from an ecosystem perspective. We have also parameterized and simulated the physiographic dynamics of the ecosystem, as well as the most important fleets. Our goal was to recreate, at least in approximate terms, the biomass, catch, and effort trends in the NEUS from 1964 to the mid 2000s.

The spatial domain of the model

The model takes about 12 hours to run so we have containerized the model and it is run in the cloud during the calibration process
