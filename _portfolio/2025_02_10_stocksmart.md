Stock assessments reports are typically lengthy documents containing a
great deal of information. This repo contains time series data for all
Federally assessed stocks in the United States. The following time
series are available:

- Catch - By weight or by number of individuals (species specific)
- Abundance - By weight or by number of individuals (species specific)
- Index - An index of abundance (shrimp only)
- Recruitment - By weight or by number of individuals (species specific)
- Fishing mortality

Summary statistics for these assessments are also available (FMSY, BMSY,
Ftarget etc) in addition to metadata (Stock Name, Stock Area,
Jurisdiction, Point of contact, Year of assessment etc)

The data are extracted and processed from NOAA’s [Stock
SMART](https://apps-st.fisheries.noaa.gov/stocksmart) web based data portal.
