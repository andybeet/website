This will be a short and sweet entry. No fluff!

When using any type of versioning software, either collaboratively or not, there are a few best practices that should be followed regarding branching strategies.
The article [git branching strategy](https://blog.prateekjain.dev/the-ultimate-guide-to-git-branching-strategies-6324f1aceac2) outlines several strategies from which to choose.
The strategy that I regularly adopt and recommend to my collaborators is "Feature Branching". Chapter 7 in the above article.

How feature branching works:

* You have a main branch (called `main`). This is where your most recent release (if developing software) will reside. Anyone installing your software/package will expect this to be a functioning version.
* A development branch (called `dev` or `develop`) which is a branch of `main`. This is where all of your features are merged prior to a formal release (or merging into `main`)
* Multiple feature branches (named based on feature development or bug fix) that are branches of `dev` and are worked on independently until merged into `dev`

From the article above, the figure below depicts the flow:

Regardless of the branching strategy there are a few best practices that should be followed:

* Adopt a consistent naming structure for features or bug fixes
* Merge frequently to prevent merging issues (Don't work on branches for long periods of time)
  * This is helped by breaking large tasks into small tasks
* Utilize Code reviews. All merging of code should be via pull requests
  * Adopt a policy of what the testing should involve
  * Identify how many reviewers should be requested
  * This will enhance the teams knowledge in the process and the product and will provides a check for overlooked bugs
* Add automation testing for common checks
  * Do any commits break the currently working product?
* Document these best practices
* Remove branches after they have been merged

Lots to think about!
