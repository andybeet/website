[Markdown for GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) is the language of choice when creating issues, pull requests, using discussions, or editing your README file on GitHub. 

You can even create markdown files (they have an `.md` extension) anywhere in your repo and GitHub will render them as readable, just like your `README.md` file

It is simple to use, human readable, and will take you about an hour or two to learn. Using it will enhance the look of your comments/discussions and people will appreciate it. So why not spend an hour to read up on `markdown`

You can add code blocks in the form of [reproducible examples]({{site.baseurl}}/posts/2024/01/reprex/) in any of the above mentioned formats
